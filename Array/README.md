# Arrays

- This directory contains my solutions to array-related problems from LeetCode and HackerRank.
- Arrays are fundamental data structures, and solving problems related to arrays helps improve algorithmic and problem-solving skills.

## What is an Array?

-  An array is a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements of the same data type.
- Each element is identified by an index, usually starting from 0, and is stored in contiguous memory locations.

## Common Operations on Arrays:

- append(): Adds an element to the end of the array.

- insert(): Inserts an element at a specified index in the array.

- pop(): Removes and returns the element at a specific index (default is the last element).

- remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified element from the array.

- index(): Finds the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in the array.

- reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in the array.

- **Accessing Elements()**: Elements are accessed using their indices.

- **Deletion()**: Elements can be removed based on index or value.

- **Iteration()**: Arrays support iteration using loops.
